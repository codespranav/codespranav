# 👋 Hi, I'm Pranav Singh

I'm a full-stack developer who loves building practical, creative, and clean web experiences using **Next.js**, **React**, and **Node.js**. I enjoy turning ideas into products — whether it's a SaaS tool, a personal website, or a startup MVP.

Sometimes I fall in love with bugs that take 3 hours to fix and teach me things that tutorials never could.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- 🔍 Exploring new tech stacks and UI patterns
- 🧠 Working on my startup ideas (like NoteWave 📝 or Dev Gloss 🧩)
- 🎧 Vibing to lofi or Indian classical fusion
- 🌌 Taking solo walks and daydreaming ideas in peace
- 📺 Watching anime that makes me question reality

> *Building quietly but consistently...*
